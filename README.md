# Fake News/Images Detection
There are 3 models for fake news detection: CNN, logistic regression, and SVM

The dataset for fake news detection is from `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadyasingh55/fake-news-classification?select=evaluation.csv`

There are 5 models for fake images detection: CNN, diffusion, gan, resnet, and SVM

The dataset for fake images detection is from `https`

## CNN_Fake_News
Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` in `CNN_Fake_News/` to run this part. 

Run `main.py` in `src/` to start training.

Result plots will be saved to the `src/`, see `output.txt`or a log during a previous training.

See `results` for plots for our previous training.


## LR+SVM_Fake_News.ipynb





## Fake_Images
Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` in the `Fake_Images/`  to run this part. 

Put the dataset folder in `Fake_Images/`, name it to `ddata`

Run `cnn.py`, `diffusion.py`, `gan.py`, `resnet.py`, `svm.py` to train corresponding model. The result plot will not be saved. 

See `results` for plots for our previous training.
